# FilesGatheringAutomation

This program will develop an user-friendly excel interface for people who are not familiar with Python. People can make dual choices in excel or even update new changes in excel without updating the Python code. Its dragging file running time is also less than using macro.

Before running the program, make sure to install the following packages:
1. win32com.client
   ``` pip install pywin32```
3. datetime
   ```pip install datetime```

When installing packages with workplace PCs may encounter "Coundn't find...", can use the following line to solve
```
pip install --trusted-host pypi.org --trusted-host pypi.python.org --trusted-host files.pythonhosted.org #Package_Name
```
